My cat, Whiskers, loves to chase yarn. I think it's because she's part bobcat.
Whiskers has always been a bit wild, with her sharp instincts and playful nature. 
She often stalks her toys like a true predator, and her favorite game is hide and seek. 
She hides behind furniture and waits for the perfect moment to pounce.
It's always a surprise when she leaps out with a playful attack.
